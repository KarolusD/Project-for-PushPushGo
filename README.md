## PushPushGo Project 

**Key assumption**
Was to design & code simple static webpage about PushPushGo. <br>
:bomb:Live demo: [Here](https://www.karolpodzerek.pl/ppgo); <br><br>

In the top right corner of the page is also a link called <br>
:art:[Project](https://www.figma.com/file/F1crCHWaf7cGi7TpOIYRQ8a6/PushPushGO?node-id=0%3A1) which provide a project view source in Figma

## Used tools:hammer:

* Figma for design
* Webpack to bundle files
* Vanilla JS 
* SASS/SCSS
* HTML5

## Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org) > 7.6

## Usage

```sh
 npm install
